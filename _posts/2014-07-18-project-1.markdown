description: As a part of the Marasco Biomedical Library, I am developing a portable, noninvasive physiological sensor to detect markers of disease in low resource settings. I’m designing microcontroller firmware (in C++), a CAD 3D printed test environment, power system, and hardware filters for signal processing for a working prototype. I also write code (C++, Matlab) to observe, collect, and analyze serial data to give simple readouts. Lastly, I’m maintaining and LTSpice model and git repository for the project.
