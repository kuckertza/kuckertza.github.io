description: I created a calculator program using a binary tree as the underlying data structure to make simple use of prefix, postfix, and infix expressions. I employed multiple design patterns to make for easy modularity and exstensiblility. This includes the bridge, command, reactor, and state pattern, amongst many others. The programs runs in verbose and succint mode and is written in C++. I also made use of Google Test Suite to allow automatic testing. I wrote this program for a software design class and as such, per class guidelines, it is not public. Private access can be provided upon request.
