description: I created a basic <a href="https://github.com/kuckertza/EigenVector_Facial_Recognition_Project/blob/master/Facial_Recognition.ipynb">facial recognition program </a> by employing the principles of linear algebra. Using images from the <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/extended-yale-b-1">Extended Yale B Face Database</a>, I performed principle component analysis, calculating each image's eigen values and eigen vectors and storing the data. I then randomly selected an image and projected it into the eigen space previously calculated. I then calculated the euclidean distance between the randomly selected image and the previously analyzed images. The smallest euclidean distance represents the image in the previously analyzed data that is most similar to the randomly selected image and is chosen as the closest match.
