description: I created a <a href="https://github.com/kuckertza/Top100Game">game</a> that has players try to guess the billboard rankings of songs. The backend uses Node.js with a cheerio framework to webscrape the top <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100">100 billboard chart</a> songs and creates an API to store the songs. It connects to a react native frontend using an axios framework. The front end is still in progress.
