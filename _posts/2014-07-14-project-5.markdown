description: As a part of the <a href="https://dabh.io/">Hyde Quantum Computing Science laboratory</a>, I am collaborating on a tunable C++ framework to explore the use of classical machine learning for optimizing quantum computing algorithms. I am utilizing linear algebra and numerical algorithms to find novel quantum operators and contributing to source code dependent on Boost libraries and the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL).
