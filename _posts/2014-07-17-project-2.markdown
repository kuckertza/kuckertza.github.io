description: I created a game that has players try to guess the billboard rankings of songs. The backend uses Node.js with a cheerio framework to webscrape the top 100 songs from https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100 and creates an API to store the songs. It connects to a react native frontend using an axios framework. The front end is still in progress.
