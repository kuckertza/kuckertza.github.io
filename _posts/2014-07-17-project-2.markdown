description: I am a member of <a href="https://www.changeplusplus.org/">Change++</a>, a prestigious student led group at Vanderbilt that writes software for nonprofits. As a staunch supporter of women in tech, I was ecstatic to be matched, along with the rest of an eight-person team, to the company <a href="https://www.codeyourchances.com/">Code Your Chances</a>. CYC is an organization focused on inspiring young girls to pursue careers in the computer science field. Over the course of the school year, I learned C# and Unity and applied those skills to the design of an educational virtual reality game for CYC to use in their workshops. As a backend engineer on the project, I collaborated on a virtual bakery that uses pastry creation to teach basic coding concepts such as looping, algorithms, and functions.
